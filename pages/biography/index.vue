            <p class="tracking-wider">
              According to sketchy records and stories, Felix Chukwu was very
              intelligent during his primary school days, then it was known as
              Standard. He was also very good in sports. In football, it was
              always difficult to cross his defense line anytime he plays.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
              He was very popular and loved by his fellow pupils and teachers
              due to his intelligence and versatility. As a child, you wouldn't
              push him around or cheat him. When some of his classmates come in
              twos to fight him, they will end up being beaten by him. This
              prompted one of his teachers to nickname him DOUBLE. And that was
              how the word DOUBLE, by the villagers, metamorphosed to BUNDLE,
              hence his nickname, Feli-Bundle.

            <p class="tracking-wider">
              Felix Chukwu joined the Nigerian Army in 1963. When the Nigerian
              Civil War started, he came back to defend his people. After the
              war ended in January 1970, he was re-admitted into the Nigerian
              Army. He got several recognitions and commendations for his
              neatness, etc. And due to his flame in sporting activities, he
              represented his unit in FESTAC ’77.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
              As a military engineer, he was sent to the Nigerian Army School of
              Military Engineering, Combat Engineering Division – Markudi, to
              further his studies where he successfully completed the COMBAT
              ENGINEERING BRIDGING COURSE from May to August, 1984. He last
              served at the headquarters of the Nigerian Armed Forces
              Resettlement Center, NAFRC, Oshodi, in 1989 where he later
              disengaged (from the Army) on own request.

              Felix was a born leader. It is almost impossible to exhaust his
              roles as a leader in a short material of this nature. Right from
              his primary school days to his unit in the Nigerian Army
              Engineers, he displayed his leadership prowess. While in Calabar
              and Kaduna, he also held positions in the Church, Enugu State and
              the Nkanu People associations.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3 tracking-wider">
              Returning home, he later became the Chairman of the Catholic Men
              Organization, CMO, and St. Anthony's Zone of the St. Patrick's
              Parish, Nomeh (both for more than a tenure). Felix was one time
              Chairman of Umuonuohaeze, Chairman Umuada-Ugbawka, Financial
              Secretary Ukegeorge, CYON Patron, pioneer leader Nomeh Vigilante, etc. All through his leadership period, he
              led with sincerity of purpose and compassion.

              commitments in the church earned him the various positions and
              nominations that made him head the various positions he held in
              the Church. He had also represented the Parish at different levels
              on various occasions. He was also known for paying dues for those
              who do not come prepared to meetings.

            <p class="tracking-wider">
              Felix was a lover of his family. He grew up with his siblings, and
              being the first male child of his father, he carried everyone
              along with great care and concern. He was very sociable and
              trustworthy. He always kept in contact with his people both from
              his Father and mother's lineage no matter how far the family tree
              runs. He never fails at any point to stand and / or defend his
              siblings. Someone once told me,
              <span class="italic"
                >"your father does not allow another person’s bird to peck his
                own".</span

              His marriage to Chinyere Bridget Chukwu is blessed with two

            <p class="tracking-wider">
              Felix Chukwu’s death was dramatic and glorious. On the day he
              departed to meet with his creator, he woke up at 5 am as usual for
              morning prayers and joined by his wife, my Mother. From singing
              praises to saying the Rosary, he showed no sign of discomfort.
              After the prayers, he came outside and sat at his usual position
              and started discussing with others. A few minutes later, his
              breathing frequency increased. My mother asked, "what is
              happening?" As a man that does not like to show pain or being
              pitied, he replied,
              <span class="italic">"nothing is happening".</span> After some
              minutes, it became obvious that all was not well which prompted
              his Nephew and my Mother to take him into his room. And that was
              it, he departed.

              rest which God promised will rest from their own work, just as God
              rested from his.” – Hebrews 4: 9 & 10.
