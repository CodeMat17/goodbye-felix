            <p class="tracking-wider">
              According to sketchy records and stories, Felix Chukwu was very
              intelligent during his primary school days, then it was known as
              Standard. He was also very good in football that it was almost
              difficult to cross the defense line anytime he plays.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
              He was popular and loved by his fellow pupils and teachers due to
              his intelligence and active participation in sports. As a child
              then, you wouldn't push him around or cheat him and when you
              delibrately give him trouble, be sure to receive a DOUBLE dose,
              and that was how the word DOUBLE, by the villagers, metamorphosed
              to BUNDLE, hence his nickname, Feli-Bundle.

              Felix was a lover of his family. He grew up with his siblings, and
              being the first male child of his father, he carried everyone along with great care and
              concern. He was very sociable, noble and trustworthy. He always
              look for his people both from his Father and mother lineage no
              matter how far the family tree had grown. He always stood and
              defend his siblings and always on the side of peace. Someone once
              told me, your father does not allow another person’s bird to peck
              his own.

              Felix Chukwu’s death was dramatic and glorious. On the day he
              departed to meet with his creator, he woke up at 5 am as usual for
              morning prayers joined by his wife, my Mother. From singing praises to saying the
              Rosary he showed no sign of
              discomfort. After the prayers, he came outside and sat at his
              usual position and started discussing with others. A few minutes
              later, his breathing frequency increased. My mother
              asked, what is happening?, as a man that does not like showing
              pains or being pitied replied, nothing was happening. Noticing how he was
              breathing; his Nephew and my Mother took him into his room and
              placed him on the bed. And that was it, he departed.
