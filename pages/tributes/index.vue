              I have waited to hear that your absence was a staged drama, but my
              hopes have grown thin. You left when you had almost recovered.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the day you left us, you led the early morning prayers, where
              we sang praises to God, and you completed the Rosary. There was no
              sign whatsoever that you will begin this other journey. I leave
              everything to God.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are no longer with us in flesh, but your good works, human
              empathy, words of wisdom and admonitions will ever remain with us
              untill we meet to part no more.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will continue to cherish the moments we shared together as
              husband and wife and the children God blessed us with.
            </p>
            <p>
              Have a restful and ever shinning moment with Christ Jesus, and our
              Mother Mary, through her intercession for Divine Mercy over your
              soul.

              I was only reminded that I must write this. I wasn’t ready as the
              belief that you are gone is still faint to me.
            </p>
            <p>
              Daddy, to write a tribute for you? This is difficult. This must be
              a dream and I need to wake from it.
            </p>
            <p>Where do I start from?</p>
            <p>
              Dad, we had plans, and death wasn't part of it. oh! death, where
              is thy sting? You took my MAN, you took my HERO, you took my
              MENTOR. Well, I cannot question God.
            </p>
            <p>
              The gong calls a man twice, once in life, and once in death. My
              only consolation about this is the fact that, 2 hours before your
              second gong call, you sang praises to God in the usual family
              morning prayers, where you even led the rosary yourself. That
              gives me an insight of where you are right now.
            </p>
            <p>
              Daddy, I will miss your early morning phone calls to checkup on me
              and "Nwa m" as you always refer to my wife.
            </p>
            <p>
              I thank God and thank you for whatever I am today. You had this
              strong passion for Education and you sponsored those around you
              who were ready to go to school. Right from my Primary School days,
              you taught me a way to read and it will stick, bought advanced
              books to prepare me ahead, and arranged for after-school and
              holiday lessons for me. I will miss you Dad.
            </p>
            <p>
              You were principled to the core. In all you did, you tried to
              achieve your goals with minimal or zero errors. You taught me the
              true definition of humility, credibility, trustworthiness, and
              being God-fearing. Even 3 weeks before your demise when I came
              home to see you and Mom, you still spoke with me about respecting
              my elders and seniors at my place of work. I will miss you Dad.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your love for your family, siblings, nephews, nieces etc was never
              in doubt. You never allowed anything to stand in your way in
              defending your relatives. I will miss you Dad.
            </p>
            <p>
              I can go on and on, but words are not enough; words will never be
              enough to describe you and what you stood for. We will keep
              praying for the repose of your soul, for God to give us the
              fortitude to bear the vacuum your demise has created and to be
              able to hold forth the true love you propagated amongst your
              relations, both far and near.

              A great hero has fallen. God Almighty called you to glory after
              the usual family morning devotion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Daddy the time you were sick, each time I checkup on you, you
              always gave me words of faith, you would say, "mummy, don't worry,
              my faith is strong, nothing will happen to me. It is just a matter
              of time, I will be fine". Untill that faithful day that God called

              Death is inevitable, we shall all leave this world someday but the

            <p>
              I accepted it as the will of God though my heart is heavy and my
              eyes coated with tears. You left us at the time we needed you the
              most.
            </p>
            <p>
              I cannot question God, who am I? God knows the best. In all
              conditions, we still give HIM praise. My lovely dad, I really miss
              you, I miss your early morning calls, I miss your advice. You
              never stopped instructing us to be committed to God and prayerful
              at all times. My prayer is, God should grant you eternal rest.

            <p class="tracking-wider">
              As a writer and a poet, I just realised that one of the hardest
              things to do is to say goodbye forever.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every girl comes from a father and if you are lucky enough you
              will be gifted another. I am a lucky girl to have had both.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don’t know where to begin, all I keep thinking is how I wish I
              had that “one more” opportunity to see you, daddy, to hear your
              voice calling me "Nwam" as you called me and to see you smile when
              you eat my food and call me "Oshirioha.
            </p>
            <p>
              You had an unmitigated faith in God and never ceased to stress his
              unfailing love. This is evident with your service to the Catholic
              Church particularly the CMO. You had a prayer life worthy of
              emulation as you never missed your routine morning and night
              prayers. Even a few hours before your demise you led the early
              morning prayer.
            </p>
            <p>
              You lived your life with grace, unalloyed loyalty, and
              benevolence. You always put others before you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dad lived for his family both nuclear and extended, always willing
              to help. Maybe a little too much.
            </p>
            <p>
              You were like the rain which falls for everyone and the sun whose
              brightness is never selective.
            </p>
            <p>
              A man who says and stands by the truth no matter whose ox is
              gored. You are among the last breed of this rare generation.
              Probably one of your traits I admire the most because it reminds
              me of my father.
            </p>
            <p>
              A war veteran, a leader, husband, father, father-in-law, Uncle,
              grandfather, and held office in his community and the church; you
              lived your life to the fullest.
            </p>
            <p>
              I lost you but I thank you for giving me one of the best gifts of
              my life. I am honored to have had the privilege to have been able
              to call the late Felix Chukwu “Dad.”

              no one can heal.
            </p>
            <p>
              So Dad, see you in heaven. We will take solace in the fact that"
              those we love don't go away, they walk beside us every day,
              unseen, unheard, but always near, still loved, missed and being

              When the mirror is broken, you no longer see your image in it.
              That has been the situation since the day you departed from this
              world to join the saints, and things have never remained the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              Uncle, you were the mirror in which I looked at myself, and now
              that you are gone, there is a vacuum created in my life and my
              soul feels it too. My solace is in the fact that you lived a
              righteous life. Every moment of your life was like a book on a

              Death is a necessary end that comes when it comes. It is a natural
              phenomenon that marks the transition to another phase of life. On
              the day it happened in his compound after his morning prayer with
              his wife in his bedroom, he then came out to the corridor to sit
              on his chair as he used to chat in the morning with me before I go
              out for the day. As he sat down there, came a little bit of cough,
              as the cough continued, we took him back to his bedroom to rest.
              And that was how death snatched our father away from us.

              particular and umuonuohaeze and Nomeh Unataeze in general was
              peace and progress.

              Bundle as he was called, refused to go out again, thanking
              Almighty God for his protection during the military coup in
              Kaduna, Nigeria/ Biafra civil war, and also recalled back to the
              Nigerian Army. Nwaenyim mmili, later became the Chairman of
              umuonuohaeze community some years ago and later resıgned. He is
              known to be somebody who is not afraid to put forth his views on
              issues even where such would be deemed as controversial in certain
              quarters. This could perhaps have been the main reason why some
              people have continued to nurse a less than charitable opinion of
              him. Today, a mighty tree has fallen, he has left a vacuum that
              might be difficult to fill.
            </p>
            <p>
              Daddy, you touched many life's in various ways, your advice and
              encouragement to me will remain indelible in my heart, and that of
              my family.
            </p>
            <p>
              What a greater achievement one needs to make on earth than to live
              on truth till he or she dies. The associations under your control
              e.g. Umuada Ugbawka and others cannot forget you Sir.
            </p>
            <p>
              The word of God must be fulfilled in one's life. A time to born
              and a time to die and death is the key that opens eternity.
            </p>
            <p>
              MY HERO !! Bundle, Nwaenyım mmili as my mother and grandmother
              call you, God is the giver of life and he is the one that takes it
              back, let the name of the Lord be glorified in Jesus name.
            </p>
            <p>
              We love you but God loves you most. Good night my HERO. We are
              consoled by the good legacies you left behind for us.

          </h3>
          <p class="tracking-wider py-4">
            Oh death, you did what you do because God allowed you to do so, for
            I know it was God's time to take my in-law to himself. My in-law,
            you were a mentor, a disciplinarian, a man of his word, a peace
            loving in-law, and a counselor. An in-law that visit his in-laws as
            if Ugbakwa is in Nomeh. My in-law, who did you keep to advice us?
            Oh! my God. I will continue to remember your counseling work in our
            family. You were a hero, a champion. You were not a bed room
            champion or a village champion. You fought in the Biafran war and Mr
            death did not kill you. You later joined the Nigerian Army and
            retired, Mr death was unable to take you; this is why I called you a
            National champion, my hero, my great sergeant. In-law, may your soul
            rest in peace, Amen.

            <p class="tracking-wider">
              I find it hard to accept the fact that you are no more with us.
              You were a great hero, the best inlaw anyone can wish to have, you
              were more than an inlaw to me and my siblings, and for me, you
              have always been a father to me because the day you came to marry
              my one and only sister, I insisted on going with my sister to
              wherever she was going to, you accepted that I should come along.
              I was just 5 years then. From that moment on I became your little
              boy. I sat comfortably on your shoulder back to your town from my
              own town, and we later traveled back to your base, Port Harcourt,
              and from Port Harcourt to Ikot Ekpene, and to Oron and to Calabar.
              Wherever we were, people believed you were my biological father
              and they call you Papa Emman, and you were indeed a father.
            </p>
            <p>
              You thought me what humility is all about. You made me understand
              that nothing could be better than honesty.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sir, I will miss you. I will miss your fatherly advice. I will
              also miss your prayers. The last time I spoke with you on phone,
              little did I know it was going to be the last. You prayed for me
              as usual and you ended it with the same words that you always use,
              "Emma you will come back alive in good health to meet us alive in
              good health ", and I responded, Amen !!! Little did I know that I
              will not see you again until that great resurrection morning.
            </p>
            <p>
              We love you but God loves you more. We know you are in a better
              place where there is no sickness and death.

          <div class="space-y-4 py-4">
            <p class="tracking-wider">
              Uncle Felix, you were a HERO. You were the most courageous,
              incorruptible, resourceful, and fearless man I have ever met. A
              disciplinarian but most loving. I never questioned if you loved me
              because you made it obvious.
            </p>
            <p>
              Uncle, I am very thankful for all you taught me which I may not be
              able to recount now. You taught me to face challenges head-on and
              never be afraid of anything or anyone. I can tell a lot of stories
              about your qualities because I once lived with you in Calabar and
              in Kaduna, during your days as a Soldier. So many other stories I
              heard and I will never forget this one my paternal Uncle once told
              me. He said, "during our days in school, there is this particular
              dog that visits once in a while to disturb. Whenever it visits,
              the students will scamper for their dear lives. But on this
              particular day, Your Uncle Felix challenged the dog, and the dog
              became so aggressive. Before we knew it, Felix grabbed the dog by
              its neck and smashed its head on the wall and the dog died a few
              seconds after".
            </p>
            <p>
              You were a man of great courage. You make decisions for the good
              of your relatives and stand by them. You never allowed yourself to
              be bent by external forces to adulterate your good decisions. You
              loved with open arms and we (your relatives) can attest to this. I
              will miss you, Uncle Felix.
            </p>
            <p>
              Uncle, you were credible and a nobleman. You served your country
              as a Soldier, community, and family. Everyone got the guidance
              needed from you. I am very grateful for knowing and having you as
              an Uncle, I will miss you dearly.

              life, your love, and care for your family will always remain alive

              I first got to see you and know you way back in 1954 when my
              Father was at Post Office in Nkanu Native Authority, Agbani. Then
              you and late Mr. Dan. Egbo and late Mr. Michael Nworie came for
              church function at St. John’s Primary School, Agbani.
            </p>
            <p>
              That evening, my Father brought all of us together and introduced
              you as my relation from my father’s side and the other two as my
              relations from my mother’s side.
            </p>
            <p>
              Again, in 1957, my father was transferred to Customary Court
              Mburubu and we the family were brought back to live at Railway
              Station, Nomeh. I was enrolled at St. Peters Primary School, Nomeh
              where you and I met again as pupils.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some years later, you enrolled into the Nigerian Army and you sent
              to me your photograph in Army uniform. You told me the story of
              your experience at the beginning of the crisis that led to the
              civil war and how God gave you safety back to the Eastern Region.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the civil war, you fought on the side of the Biafran Army –
              as an Army Engineer. At the end of the war, God granted you safety
              back to Nomeh into the warm embrace of your dear mother.
            </p>
            <p>
              Surprisingly, at the end of the civil war, you were one of those
              who were re-enlisted into the Nigerian Army where you served until
              retirement and then you came back home to Nomeh.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is significant that during all those services with the Nigerian
              Army, then the Biafran Army and again the Nigerian Army, you came
              back alife without any broken limb.
            </p>
            <p>
              One thing is certain to us in this life, once anyone is born into
              this life, he or she must at the end die. And so brother, you
              have answered the call of nature. While alife, you took care of your spiritual life.

              News of the death of your father and father in-law of my daughter
              came to my family as a shock. As a matter of fact, the news of the

              father lived a Christian life.
            </p>
            <p>
              From every consideration, your father was known to most of the
              leading members of Agbi nta, my biological father‘s extended
              family many of whom witnessed the marriage ceremony between you

              I received the news of your father’s demise with shock. It is
              still painful and difficult to accept that he is gone, though we
              are left without a choice. Your father was a man of peace, kind
              and warm-hearted in all his ways. He was so courageous and always
              expecting the best. His positive outlook instilled discipline and
              devotion in many that were around him.
            </p>
            <p>
              Caring and resourceful father like no other, we love him just as
              he loved us. His memories will remain indelible in our hearts.
            </p>
            <p>
              For it is, when one’s assignments are completed, it becomes
              expedient for him/her to respectfully answer that divine call.
              This is what happened.

              We wish to express our heartfelt condolence to Mr. Matthew & Mrs.
              Uchanta Chukwu and the entire Chukwu family on the demise of their
              father, brother, uncle and son, Mr. Felix Chukwu. Daddy was an
              icon and a hero who as an army veteran dedicated his life to
              serving our fatherland. He was a wonderful father and will be
              dearly missed. May his soul rest in perfect peace and May God
              grant the family the fortitude to bear the loss.
